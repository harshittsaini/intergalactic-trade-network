# Intergalactic Trade Network Backend ðŸš€

The Intergalactic Trade Network Backend is a Node.js and Express-based backend system that manages trade transactions, space cargo shipments, and inventory tracking across space stations and planets. It provides real-time updates via Socket.IO and includes API routes for trade management, cargo handling, and inventory monitoring.


## Features

- Manage trade transactions between space stations and planets.
- Handle cargo shipment creation, tracking, and status updates.
- Monitor inventory levels at different space stations.
- Receive real-time updates on trade and cargo events via WebSocket (Socket.IO).
- Scalable backend architecture with MongoDB for data storage.



## Tech Stack

**Node.js:** Backend runtime environment

**Express.js:** Web framework for routing and middleware handling.

**MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing trades, cargo, and inventory.

**Socket.IO:** Real-time communication between the backend and clients.

**Mongoose:** MongoDB ODM for structured schema and data validation.

**Event-Driven Architecture:** For simulating real-time event updates.



## Installation

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (version 12.x or higher)
- MongoDB (Local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- NPM (Comes with Node.js)

**Setup Instructions**
- Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/harshittsaini/intergalactic-trade-network.git
  cd intergalactic-trade-network
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

- Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables

```bash
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/intergalactic-trade-network
  PORT=5000
```

- Start the server:
    
```bash
  nodemon server.js
```

The backend will now run at http://localhost:5000.
## API Reference

#### Trade Routes

- **Post Item**
Initiate a new trade transaction.

```http
  POST /api/trades
```

- **Get Item**
Retrieve details of a trade transaction.

```http
  GET /api/trades/{transactionId}
```


#### Cargo Routes

- **Post Item**
Create a new cargo shipment.

```http
  POST /api/cargo
```

- **Get Item**
Retrieve cargo shipment details.

```http
  GET /api/cargo/{shipmentId}
```

#### Inventory Routes

- **Get Item**
Retrieve inventory levels for a space station.

```http
  GET /api/inventory/{stationId}
```

## Real-Time Features

This project uses Socket.IO to provide real-time updates for trade transactions and cargo shipment statuses.

- Real-Time Trade Updates: The server emits trade events to connected clients.
- Real-Time Cargo Updates: Receive live updates on cargo shipment status and location.

To see real-time events in action:

- Start the backend server.
- Monitor the server logs to view real-time trade and cargo events.
- Optionally, connect a WebSocket client (or implement a front-end using Socket.IO) to subscribe to these events.

## Known Limitations

- **Simulated Events:** The real-time events are currently simulated. In a production environment, these would be triggered by actual trade transactions and cargo status changes.
- **No Front-End:** This repository only includes the backend. A front-end would be required to visualize the real-time updates (trade, cargo status, etc.).
- **Authentication:** The API currently lacks authentication. In a real-world scenario, you would want to secure the API with JWT or OAuth.
## Future Improvements

- **Front-End Dashboard:** Build a real-time analytics dashboard to visualize trade volume, cargo status, and inventory levels.
- **Event Persistence:** Implement a persistent event system using message queues (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka) for real-time events across distributed services.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Add authentication using JWT or OAuth to secure API routes and real-time updates.
- **Scalability:** Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling, using services like Redis for managing real-time event broadcasting across multiple servers.
